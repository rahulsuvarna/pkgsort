# Contributing to pkgsort

Thank you for considering a contribution! pkgsort aims to feel like a mature,
trustworthy open-source product, and that starts with a welcoming, well-defined
contribution process. Please also read our
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug.** Especially anything touching **safety** (data loss) or
  **determinism** (different output on different machines) — these are our
  highest-severity categories.
- **Propose a feature.** Open an issue first so we can check it against the
  [PRD](./docs/PRD.md) and [Roadmap](./docs/ROADMAP.md) before you build.
- **Improve docs.** Clear docs are a core deliverable, not an afterthought.
- **Send a pull request.** See below.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22 LTS** or newer
- Any package manager — pkgsort is package-manager agnostic. The examples below
  use **npm** (bundled with Node); substitute Yarn, pnpm, or Bun freely.

## Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pkgsort/pkgsort.git
cd pkgsort
npm install
npm run check   # typecheck + lint + format:check + test
```

## Everyday commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Compile `src/` to `dist/`. |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check without emitting. |
| `npm run lint` / `lint:fix` | Lint (typed) / autofix. |
| `npm run format` / `format:check` | Prettier write / verify. |
| `npm run test` / `test:watch` | Run the suite / watch mode. |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run with coverage thresholds. |
| `npm run check` | Everything CI runs, locally. |

## Repository layout

The codebase follows the "pure core, effectful shell" design from
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). This is the recommended structure;
directories are created as the corresponding milestone lands.

```

**The load-bearing rule:** nothing in `src/core/` or `src/sorters/` may import
`src/utils/fs.ts` or otherwise perform I/O. The core is pure so it is
deterministic and trivially testable. Reviewers will reject PRs that blur this
boundary.

## Testing expectations

Any behavioural change needs tests. In particular:

- New formatting or sorting behaviour needs an **integration fixture** (input
  + expected output).
- Anything affecting output must not break the **idempotency** and **round-trip
  safety** invariant suites.
- CLI changes need an **e2e** test asserting stdout/stderr and exit code.

Coverage thresholds are enforced (see `vitest.config.ts`); PRs that drop
coverage below threshold will fail CI.

## Coding standards

- TypeScript **strict**; no `any` that isn't justified in a comment.
- Prefer pure functions; keep I/O at the edges.
- Let Prettier handle formatting — don't hand-format.
- Keep dependencies minimal; adding a runtime dependency requires justification
  in the PR description.

## Commit & PR conventions

- We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`).
- **Every user-facing change must include a changeset:** run `npx changeset`
  and commit the generated file. This drives versioning and the changelog.
- Keep PRs focused; one logical change per PR. Fill out the PR description:
  *what*, *why*, and *how it was tested*.
- CI (lint, typecheck, format, full test matrix) must be green before review.

## Releasing (maintainers)

Releases are managed with [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
Merging the "Version Packages" PR publishes to npm with provenance. Contributors
never need to publish manually.
